# SCAR001_DC_LISN
5µH DC LISN for conducted EMI measurements

This is a simple 5µH DC LISN design made in KiCad.
A "Line Impedance Stabilization Network" (LISN) is used for conducted EMC measurements.
It is a partial implementation of Linear Technology's DC2130A.
It features a -10dB attenuator and provides AC coupling to the spectrum analyzer using 50 ohm transmission lines
through an SMA connector.

It is a very simple design. For some more information look at the schematic.
